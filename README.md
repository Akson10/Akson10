## ✨ A few words about me

🤖 I love the world of technology — a field that shows we're already living in the world of science fiction.  
📈 I'm always looking to improve myself and learn something new whenever I get the opportunity to.  
🛠️ I enjoy taking an unconventional approach to problems — sometimes originality is the key to real breakthroughs.  
🏀 I'm also passionate about sports, especially basketball.
